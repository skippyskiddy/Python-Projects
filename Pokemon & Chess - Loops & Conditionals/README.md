## Summary
This project concerned three programming tasks. The first task required me to draw a circle in Turtle graphics and erase it when the user clicks on it. The second task involved writing functions to determine if a chessboard square is black or white and if the row/column is valid. The final task involved writing a program for a Pokémon tournament where the computer and human player battle with Rock-Paper-Scissors, and the winner is determined based on the Pokémon's choices. Overall, this assignment was an exercise on how to use while loops effectively and write clear and concise code that adheres to a style guide while dealing with multiple, complex conditional statements.
