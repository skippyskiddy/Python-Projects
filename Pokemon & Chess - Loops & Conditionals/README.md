## Summary
For the first task of this project, the requirement was to use Turtle graphics to draw a circle and erase it when clicked by the user.

The second task was to create functions to determine if a square on a chessboard is black or white and if the row/column is valid.

For the third task, I was required to write a program for a Pokémon tournament where the computer and human player battle using Rock-Paper-Scissors, and the winner is determined based on the Pokémon's choices.

The focus of this project was on using while loops effectively, writing clear and concise code, and adhering to a style guide while dealing with complex conditional statements.
