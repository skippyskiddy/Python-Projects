## Summary

The project involved testing and debugging two functions, writing a function to calculate windchill, and using the Python Turtle library to draw shapes. Test cases were written for two functions that convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit, and a function called calculate_windchill() was created that uses these functions to calculate the windchill index in Fahrenheit. Lastly, the Python Turtle library was used to create an application window and draw shapes such as squares and circles that were moved to new positions based on user input. Through this project, programming skills in writing functions, testing, debugging, and using Python libraries for graphics were honed.

Overall, this assignment helped me practice writing functions and using Python libraries for graphics.
