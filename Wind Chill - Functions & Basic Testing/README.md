## Summary

In this assignment, we focused on functions, testing, and debugging. The rogramming component consisted of three parts: testing two functions, writing a function that calculates windchill, and using the Python Turtle library to draw shapes.

I started by writing test cases for two functions that convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature scales. We had to write our test functions and a main function in a separate file and include the if name == "main": trick to protect our main() function from running inadvertently.

I wrote a function called calculate_windchill() that takes two parameters: temperature (Fahrenheit) and speed (Miles-per-hour) and returns the windchill index in Fahrenheit. We were asked to use the windchill index formula given in Celsius and use the temperature_conversion functions we tested earlier to convert the units.

Finally, as a seperate component, I used the Python Turtle library to render an application window and draw shapes, including a square and an inscribed circle. We prompted the user for new coordinates for the square and circle and moved the shapes to their new positions by erasing the original square and circle and drawing them in the new location.

Overall, this assignment helped me practice writing functions and using Python libraries for graphics.
