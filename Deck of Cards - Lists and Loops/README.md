## Summary
This project consists of three programming tasks.

The first task involves decoding a run-length encoded list using only specific methods and operators. The program should take an RLE-encoded list as input and return the decoded list with expanded runs.

The second task requires creating functions for creating, shuffling, and dealing cards to multiple players. The functions should use lists to simulate a deck of cards and create a specified number of hands. The program should provide create_deck(), shuffle(cards), and deal(number_of_hands, number_of_cards, cards) functions.

The third task asks for a Python function that determines whether a given list of integers represents a valid UPC. The program should use a loop to apply the algorithm described in the instructions and return a boolean indicating the validity of the input. This task provides practice with loops, arithmetic operations, and conditional statements in Python.
