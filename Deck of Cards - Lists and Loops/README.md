## Summary
This assignment included three tasks: 

For the first task, we are asked to write a program that decodes a run-length encoded list. The function should take a list of RLE-encoded values and return a list containing the decoded values with the “runs” expanded. We are only allowed to use len(), pop(), extend(), append(), and list slices using the [:] operator.

The second task requires us to create functions that use lists to create, shuffle, and deal cards to a number up to 4 “hands”. We must provide the following functions: create_deck(), shuffle(cards), and deal(number_of_hands, number_of_cards, cards).

The third task asks us to write a Python function that determines whether a given list of integers represents a valid UPC. The function should use a loop to apply the algorithm described in the instructions and return a boolean indicating whether the given input is valid or not.
