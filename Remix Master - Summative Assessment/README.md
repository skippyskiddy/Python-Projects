## Summary

This project involves the development of a music manipulation program called ReMix Master. It allows users to substitute individual words in a song with a different word, reverse the song, play back the song, reset it to the original version, and load a new song from a playlist. The project requires computational thinking, procedural decomposition, and good function design, with each function performing a specific task.
