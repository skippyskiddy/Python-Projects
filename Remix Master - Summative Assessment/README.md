## Summary

For this programming assignment, I developed a solution called ReMix Master that allows users to manipulate a song by substituting individual words of the song with a different word of their choosing, reversing the song, playing back the song, resetting the song to the original version, and loading a new song from a playlist. To achieve this, I used computational thinking, procedural decomposition, and good function design to create separate functions that performed specific tasks.
