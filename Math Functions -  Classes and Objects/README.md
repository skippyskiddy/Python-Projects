## Summary
This project involved creating a SimpleFraction class that manages rational numbers. The class implements several methods, including init(), get_numerator(), get_denominator(), make_reciprocal(), validate(), multiply(), divide(), str(), and eq().

The SimpleFraction class is designed to handle the creation of a new instance by supplying integer values for the numerator and denominator, or by using default values of 1 and 1 for the numerator and denominator. It also handles non-integer values passed to init() and validate() by raising a ValueError.

To ensure that the SimpleFraction class works as expected, a SimpleFractionTest class was created using the PyUnit framework. This class tests the methods implemented in SimpleFraction and ensures that they are functioning as expected. The grade for this project is determined by the sufficiency of testing done for the methods implemented in SimpleFraction.

Overall, this project provided valuable experience in object-oriented programming, testing, and using Python libraries to create a functional program.
