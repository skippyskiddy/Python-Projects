## Summary
This assignment involved creating a SimpleFraction class that manages rational numbers. The class was required to implement several methods, including init(), get_numerator(), get_denominator(), make_reciprocal(), validate(), multiply(), divide(), str(), and eq().

The SimpleFraction class had to be able to handle the creation of a new instance by supplying integer values for the numerator and denominator, or by using default values of 1 and 1 for the numerator and denominator. The class also had to be able to handle non-integer values passed to init() and validate() by raising a ValueError.

In addition to creating the SimpleFraction class, I created a SimpleFractionTest class that used the PyUnit framework to test the methods implemented in SimpleFraction. Our grade for this portion of the homework was determined by the sufficiency of testing done for the methods implemented in SimpleFraction.
