## Summary

This project involves designing and implementing three Python programs to calculate monthly electric bills, ATM withdrawals, and office area and cost. These programs require an understanding of basic data types and arithmetic operations, as well as using functions and formatting output to meet given specifications.

By completing this project, I've gained valuable experience in problem-solving, program design, and documentation. It also teaches how to write effective test cases and create flowcharts to improve program design. Overall, this project serves as a valuable introduction to Python programming and lays a foundation for future projects and programming challenges.
