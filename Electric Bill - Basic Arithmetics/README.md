## Summary

For this assignment, I completed three programming components to test my understanding of basic data types, arithmetic operations, and writing simple programs in Python. The programming components included designing and implementing programs to calculate monthly electric bills, ATM withdrawals, and office area and cost.

Through this assignment, I learned about the different types of values and expressions in Python, how to structure Python programs using functions, and how to format output to match the given specifications. I also gained experience in writing test cases and flowcharts to improve my program design and documentation.

## Notes 

Overall, this assignment helped me to solidify my understanding of the basics of Python programming and problem-solving. It was one of my first programming experiences, and I will continue to work on improving my program design and documentation.
