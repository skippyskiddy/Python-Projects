## Python-Projects -  Welcome!

In this repository, you'll find a collection of basic Python assignments that I completed within the first part of my ongoing programming journey. These assignments cover a wide range of topics, including basic data structures, conditionals, object-oriented programming, and more. 

Notable projects include: 
* [Remix Master](https://github.com/skippyskiddy/Python-Projects/tree/main/Remix%20Master%20-%20Summative%20Assessment)- a song remixing solution that focuses on computational thinking and procedural decomposition by splitting, joining, and indexing song lyrics 
* [Pokemon Tournament](https://github.com/skippyskiddy/Python-Projects/tree/main/Pokemon%20%26%20Chess%20-%20Loops%20%26%20Conditionals) - building a basic pokemon game restricted to arrays and while loops, handling several  
* [SimpleFraction](https://github.com/skippyskiddy/Python-Projects/tree/main/Math%20Functions%20-%20%20Classes%20and%20Objects) - building a simple fraction class that manages rational numbers with input management and PyUnit testing.
